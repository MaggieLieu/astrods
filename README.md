# astrods

astrods provides a collection of ready-to-use datasets in Astronomy for use with TensorFlow, Jax, and other Machine Learning frameworks. The datasets have been built with the tensorflow-datasets (tfds) dataset builder and therefore it handles the downloading and preparing of the data deterministically and the construction of the tf.data.Dataset object.
